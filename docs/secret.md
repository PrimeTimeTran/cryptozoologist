# Secret usage

If you just want a word list, you can tap directly into the dictionaries. Each dictionary returns an array of strings, allowing you to use the Ruby enumerators that you want on your word list.

The complete list of dictionaries includes:

* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.animals`
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.clothing`
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.colors`
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.quantity`
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.filler` ("a", "the", etc)
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.punctuation`
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.addresses` ("Lane", "Street", etc - I don't know what this part of an address is called!)
* `Cryptozoologist::Dictionary.cities`
